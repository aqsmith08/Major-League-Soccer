## aqsmith / Major-League-Soccer

Repository will contain Major League Soccer (MLS) analysis and data visualizations.

* If you have ideas on interesting MLS analysis, let me know.
* I'd love feedback especially on how my R code could be improved.

For MLS Attendance, I'd like to add the following data points:

* Stadium attendance capacity
* # of miles between home_team and away_team
* Time of game
* Average attendance by team in 2014
* Game anticipation (maybe measured by # of tweets in previous seven days before game date)
