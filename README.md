## aqsmith / Major-League-Soccer

Repository will contain Major League Soccer (MLS) analysis and data visualizations.

Things I know to be true:
* I'm a relative R newb. (Read: Go easy on me.)
* If you have ideas on interesting MLS analysis, let me know.
* I'd love feedback especially on how my R code could be improved.
